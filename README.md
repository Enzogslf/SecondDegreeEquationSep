# SecondDegreeEquationSep
a program that separates second degree equations into a,b and c(X^2,X and number), writen in java<br>
<br>

currently in primitive state, only works when string is placed into a variable in the "test.java" file, and just displays numbers in an order, not ordered by its contents.<br>

todo: get number by their letter value instead of position<br>
      make a scanner to capture user input<br>
      move things fromm test file to main file<br>
      provide executable<br>
      make it loopable, so tne program doesnt close after first use<br>
