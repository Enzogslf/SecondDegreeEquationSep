# SecondDegreeEquationSep
a program that separates second degree equations into a,b and c(X^2,X and number), writen in java


currently in primitive state, only works when string is placed into a variable in the "test.java" file, and just displays numbers in an order, not ordered by its contents.

todo: get number by their letter value instead of position\n
      make a scanner to capture user input\n
      move things fromm test file to main file\n
      provide executable\n
      make it loopable, so tne program doesnt close after first use
