# SecondDegreeEquationSep
a program that separates second degree equations into a,b and c(X^2,X and number), writen in java<br>
<br>

currently in primitive state, problem: int's plus and minus(indexOf checkers) return the value of the empty StringBuffer, not scanner input however method Xchecker returns the scanner input, how? No idea as of recent, if the string is hardcoded onto the StringBuffer it works as "intended", not near to finished yet, but provides expected output <br>

todo: get number by their letter value instead of position<br>
      make a scanner to capture user input: DONE but buggy<br>
      move things from test file to main file: main file now extends checker.java,which is test.java renamed<br>
      provide executable: long time until i get to do this lol<br>
      make it loopable, so the program doesnt close after first use: this will be easy, hopefully<br>
      separation.java file is useless until proper packaging<br>
