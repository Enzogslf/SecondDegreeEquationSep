# New Stuff In Experimental Branch!!

currently broken<br>

ill take a break from this project for now, im annoyed at the new allindexof method<br>

comments are now more readable if you have the better comments extension :)

todo: get number by their letter value instead of position: letter value is position dumbass past me<br>
      make a scanner to capture user input:done<br>
      move things from test file to main file: main file now extends checker.java,which is test.java renamed<br>
      provide executable: long time until i get to do this lol<br>
      make it loopable, so the program doesnt close after first use: this will be easy, hopefully<br>
      separation.java file is useless until proper packaging<br>
